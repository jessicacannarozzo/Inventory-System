- Store.cc: Not sure if we need destructor? I commented it out. li.32-38
	k: ok, I inserted a line in ProdList destructor that frees the data as well

- sstream and iostream in ProdList allowed? Probably not
	k: i think it's ok since we need to return a long string with all prod info, it just won't display anything. After testing we remove the libraries we find not really needed there.

- ProdList remove(): k: added a prevNode pointer and adjusted the code as the prof did to fix seg fault in some cases 

- Size removed from list as per prof comment on forum
