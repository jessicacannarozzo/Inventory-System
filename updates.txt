Order.cc
    -decided to change the way order is constructed, by passing only a customer, and the purchases can be added one by one in purchase feature. Code in InvControl looks cleaner.

OrderServer.cc and OrderArray.cc
    - need to fix double delete of OrderArray when program is terminated. This is happening when we print the orders. In OrderServer retrieve() requires an order array as parameter to be filled in, and in the end of the program the same instance gets destroyed twice (when OrderServer is destroyed, then when InvControl is destroyed, that same reference no longer exists).
I think the solution could be making a copy constructor in OrderArray class, then in OrderServer retrieve() we first make a copy of the array passed, then fill it with order info. But then we end with en extra copy of order array just for print. Not sure we are allowed.
Another solution would be destroying the order array in OrderServer class instead of doing in OrderArray as expected, but then again we could get into problems as we did last time, having a destructor of a collection somewhere else.
What do you think? Can you think of something else?
