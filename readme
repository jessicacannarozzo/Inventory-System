*Update A2*: Dynamic memory allocation & the ability to add more inventory to the store.
*Update A3*: ProdArray replaced with ProdList, a doubly linked list. Also a new feature to reorganize stock in ascending order based on the number of units, as well as remove product feature.
*Update A4*: Ability to track and print order information. Also implemented a "facade" class to hide order process details.
*Update A5*: New product categories based on a hierarchy and products are now taxable. Date class implemented in MM/DD/YYYY format.
